# Alpha-Engine

This is a C++ implementation of the Alpha Engine outlined in: 

The Alpha Engine: Designing an Automated Trading Algorithm
Golub, Anton and Glattfelder, James B. and Olsen, Richard B.
High Performance Computing in Finance
Chapman & Hall/CRC Series in Mathematical Finance
2017

The code produced by the authors could be found here: https://github.com/AntonVonGolub/Code

Vladimir Petrov provides an adaptation of the Alpha Engine using limit orders: https://github.com/VladUZH/AlphaEngine

The algorithm in this repository introduces a number of changes yet follows the objective of using limit orders rather than market orders for trading
